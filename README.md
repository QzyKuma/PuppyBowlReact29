** Overview ** 

The API
You can find the documentation for our "Puppy Bowl" API hereLinks to an external site.. You have learned this before, but it is a good idea to re-read through it to remember what routes are available to call and what type of data you will be working on within this project.

Summing It Up
As the web developer for a site like this, your job will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, you will be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we have built that hosts the data you will need about each puppy, each of its owners, and even the teams they are on. You will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you will need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to represent that state to your users visually.

Getting Started 
For this project, you will not have a GitHub repository to clone and work from. Instead, you will build a React app from scratch. 

If you would like a written guide on how to get started, you can check out this resource hereLinks to an external site..

Like the previous project, you will have creative freedom regarding how you want to represent that data visually. However, there are a few requirements that we will ask you to complete as well. We will talk about those in the next section.
